# Take Everything

This is a mod for fabric, currently for 1.17

Serverside mod to easily take all items from an inventory. 
Taking everything from an inventory will also auto equip any armor items that you took and will swap armor if you are already wearing something of lesser value.

## Usage

If you are on 1.17, you may middle click in a container to take all items, you may also double click on an empty slot inside of conatiner to do the same.

If you are on 1.18 or higher, middle clicking will not work unless you are in creative, so you will need to double click on an empty slot.

If you are using a datapack, or having another mod run a command for you the command `/takeeverything` will take all items from a chest, as long as you have a container open while running it

If you'd like to disable the functionality of the mod, you may run the command `/takeeverything false` to disable it, and `/takeeverything true` to re-enable it.
